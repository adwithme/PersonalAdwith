It may seem harmless, but when you enter your email, you’re sharing a lot more than just that. I’m hoping this column, which includes some workarounds, persuades you to think twice before handing over your email address.\nFirst, it helps to know why companies want email addresses. To advertisers, web publishers and app makers, your email is important not just for contacting you. It acts as a digital bread crumb for companies to link your activity across sites and apps to serve you relevant ads. If this all sounds familiar, that’s because it is.\nFor decades, the digital advertising industry relied on invisible trackers planted inside websites and apps to follow our activities and then serve us targeted ads. There have been sweeping changes to this system in the past few years, including Apple’s release of a software feature in 2021 allowing iPhone users to block apps from tracking them and Google’s decision to prevent websites from using cookies, which follow people’s activities across sites, in its Chrome browser by 2024. Advertisers, web publishers and app makers now try to track people through other means — and one simple method is by asking for an email address.\nImagine if an employee of a brick-and-mortar store asked for your name before you entered. An email address can be even more revealing, though, because it can be linked to other data, including where you went to school, the make and model of the car you drive, and your ethnicity. “I can take your email address and find data you may not have even realized you’ve given to a brand,” said Michael Priem, the chief executive of Modern Impact, an advertising firm in Minneapolis. “The amount of data that is out there on us as consumers is literally shocking.” Advertising tech is continuing to evolve, so it helps to understand what exactly you’re sharing when you enter in an email address. From there, you can decide what to do.\nYour email address has become a potent piece of data.\nFor many years, the digital ad industry has compiled a profile on you based on the sites you visit on the web. Information about you used to be collected in covert ways, including the aforementioned cookies and invisible trackers planted inside apps. Now that more companies are blocking the use of those methods, new ad targeting techniques have emerged.\nOne technology that is gaining traction is an advertising framework called Unified ID 2.0, or UID 2.0, which was developed by the Trade Desk, an ad-technology company in Ventura, Calif.\nSay, for example, you are shopping on a sneaker website using UID 2.0 when a prompt pops up and asks you to share your email address and agree to receive relevant advertising. Once you enter your email, UID 2.0 transforms it into a token composed of a string of digits and characters. That token travels with your email address when you use it to log in to a sports streaming app on your TV that uses UID 2.0. Advertisers can link the two accounts together based on the token, and they can target you with sneaker ads on the sports streaming app because they know you visited the sneaker website.\nSince your email address is not revealed to the advertiser, UID 2.0 may be seen as a step up for consumers from traditional cookie-based tracking, which gives advertisers access to your detailed browsing history and personal information.\n“Websites and apps are increasingly asking for email authentication in part because there needs to be a better way for publishers to monetize their content that’s more privacy-centric than cookies,” Ian Colley, the chief marketing officer of the Trade Desk, said in an email. “The internet is not free, after all.” However, in an analysis, Mozilla, the nonprofit that makes the Firefox web browser, called UID 2.0 a “regression in privacy” because it enabled the type of tracking behavior that modern web browsers were designed to prevent. There are simpler ways for websites and apps to track your web activity through your email address. An email could contain your first and last name, and assuming you’ve used it for some time, data brokers have already compiled a comprehensive profile on your interests based on your browsing activity. A website or an app can upload your email address into an ad broker’s database to match your identity with a profile containing enough insights to serve you targeted ads.\nThe bottom line is that if you’re wondering why you are continuing to see relevant ads despite the rise of privacy tools that combat digital tracking, it’s largely because you are still sharing your email address.\nSo what to do? # There are various options for limiting the ability of advertising companies to target you based on your email address:\nCreate a bunch of email addresses. Each time a site or an app asks for your email, you could create a unique address to log in to it, such as, for example, netflixbrianchen@gmail.com for movie-related apps and services. That would make it hard for ad tech companies to compile a profile based on your email handle. And if you receive spam mail to a specific account, that will tell you which company is sharing your data with marketers. This is an extreme approach, because it’s time-consuming to manage so many email addresses and their passwords.\nUse email-masking tools. Apple and Mozilla offer tools that automatically create email aliases for logging in to an app or a site; emails sent to the aliases are forwarded to your real email address. Apple’s Hide My Email tool, which is part of its iCloud+ subscription service that costs 99 cents a month, will create aliases, but using it will make it more difficult to log in to the accounts from a non-Apple device. Mozilla’s Firefox Relay will generate five email aliases at no cost; beyond that, the program charges 99 cents a month for additional aliases.\nWhen possible, opt out. For sites using the UID 2.0 framework for ad targeting, you can opt out by entering your email address at transparentadvertising.org. (Not all sites that collect your email address are using UID 2.0, however.)\nYou could also do nothing. If you enjoy receiving relevant advertising and have no privacy concerns, you can accept that sharing some information about yourself is part of the transaction for receiving content on the internet.\nI try to take a cautious but moderate approach. I juggle four email accounts devoted to my main interests — food, travel, fitness and movies. I’ll use the movie-related email address, for example, when I’m logging in to a site to buy movie tickets or stream videos. That way, those sites and apps will know about my movie preferences, but they won’t know everything about me.

Although it seems like a new trend site like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc., or the natural outcome of many countries of social media development.\nIn the 1980s and 90s, on the technology new sites, and digital trends the growth of the internet enables the introduction of online communication services such as CompuServe American online prodigy. They introduced users to digital communication although email, bulletin bond messaging, and real-time chatting.\nThe term social media generated a buzz in the world of internet users upon its arrival and soon became huge thunder that was heard in every nook and corner of the world, social media is considered a technological marvel and a boom to mankind.\nLet’s look at the positive and negative aspects of social media. # Positive aspects # Stay connected to your close ones Social Media is a web-based platform that enables users to perform an interaction with one another. Various social media sites such as Facebook, Google+, Twitter, Reddit, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Instagram, etc. allow users to form and spread information. Video calling is an increasingly appreciated feature that allows one to stay in touch with close ones anytime and anywhere.\nDisplay your talent It is one of the best platforms available to showcase talent without any investment. There have been several cases in which social media has provided fame and success to many people for their hard work and talent so conveniently and affordably.\nFind people with similar interests Social media serves as a great channel to build friendships and relations. It gets you in touch with several people with varied interests, choices, likes, and preferences. Social media can be one of the places to find one of your thinking patterns, wavelength, and type. The company of such people fills your life with happiness.\nEarn Money Another important advantage of social media is that it can prove to be a good opportunity to make money. This can be done by selling clothes, blogging, affiliate marketing, and many more. All these ways are good sources to generate handsome income.\nNegative Aspects # Deteriorates your health Social media could be seen as one of the most significant reasons for destroying the health of people. People have become so addicted to social media. They have several social media accounts on various social media networking websites.\nThey spend a lot of time updating their profiles, liking pics, commenting on other profiles, expanding their follower list, chatting, etc. This not just disconnects them from real life, but this web-based networking also gives rise to various other negative symptoms such as eye strain, absence of rest, social withdrawal, etc.\nContinuous use of social media makes one dull, and lifeless. It leads to sleep disorders and reduces the productivity of a person. It is important to make a person aware of their excessive use and break this habit. Playing outdoor sports and in-person communication with people enhances the personality of a person.\nUnauthentic information Not every piece of information that you see on social media is true. There are a lot of profiles on social media networking websites that are fake, disguised, and unreal. This can cause a lot of harm to a person if he/she shared their personal information over social media. Also, some people like to create rumors and they spread like a wildfire. Before you trust that information, it is important to check the credibility of the information and the source.\nFake people Social media has been seen as a potential platform to meet new people. Unfortunately, just like unauthentic information, you can even meet fake people over social media. Being present on social media looks cool and exciting to people, but it has also been the reason for many heartbreaks and ruined relationships. So, be cautious before you trust anyone on social media.\nAddiction to social media Addiction is very popular and commonly seen not just in teenagers but also in youth. People are crazy after this platform. Their mornings start with social networking and end with it. This is no time for any communication with family members, neighbors, relatives, etc. Their pathetic life is limited to the electronic box. It not just spoils their personality but also their life too.\nCyberbullying Cyberbullying is another very important disadvantage of social media. It is seen that a lot of youngsters have become a victim of the casualties of cyberbullying. One of the reasons that lead to it is their excessive and ignore social media use.\nHacking Hacking is one of the commonest forms of cybercrime that is seen nowadays. Social media has a significant contribution to the occurrence of this crime. This is because a lot of personal information of people like their name, photo, family members, mobile number, occupation, marital status, the play of stay, education, events of life, etc. can be easily seen on social media. All this information can be stolen and shared all over the web. To save yourself from mishappenings, it is very important to guard your records and information.\n","date":"7 November 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/social-media/","section":"Welcome to Articles","summary":"Introduction # The roots of social media stretch far deeper than you might imagine.","title":"Social media and its impact on our life. | Positive and Negative aspects.

We are advancing our diary in the digital world with the latest Wi-Fi technology.\nHas Wi-Fi changed our lives, but is it also having a negative impact? Today we are going to discuss this topic briefly.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve all heard that Wi-Fi is bad for your health. There is an argument that Wi-Fi emits a lot of radiation which is harmful to health.\nDoes it really matter or not? If yes, what kind of problems are there?\nIn fact, the issue of where Wi-Fi causes health problems starts with its band. The first is 2.4 GHz, the next is 5 GHz. Now where there is a mistake, it is not in 2.4 or 5. The fault here is in GHz.\nThe word gigahertz worries people more than anything else. Some people may come to your house and say that there is so much gigahertz radiation in such a small room, that we are even more worried that it is wrong.\nIn this case, the thing we need to understand is radiation. It is important to understand the effects of radiation. We are living in fear that it will affect whatever someone says. When it comes to the energy of radiation, let\u0026rsquo;s first talk about the radiation of the sun coming to our earth.\nThe radiation of the sun coming to the surface of the earth is more than terahertz, not gigahertz. Are we now worried about the radiation of the sun on the earth\u0026rsquo;s surface? That is many times the frequency.\nWe are affected by radiation with frequencies of ultraviolet or higher. If the radiation from the sun\u0026rsquo;s rays around us is nothing more than a terahertz of radiation, then it is unnatural to say that the normal radiation from Wi-Fi affects us.\nIn some cases, an operator is releasing high frequency radiation. That is affecting health. In the case of Nepal, the Nepal Telecommunication Authority is regularly regulating the frequency.\n\u0026ldquo;We are measuring the radiation given by different operators according to our schedule. Its radiation ranges from 2.4 GHz to 5 GHz. Radiation does not affect our health in any way. It has also been certified by the International Telecommunication Union and the World Health Organization. So we don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about Wi-Fi radiation, ”said NEA director Min Prasad Aryal.\nIn fact, microwave ovens have less radiation than Wi-Fi. When cooking in such an oven, it may be understood that the food cooked by its radiation may be harmful.\nOne thing to be clear is that less radiation does not have to be more effective. The radiation we hear from X-rays, gamma rays, alpha rays, etc., is damaging our skin cells. For that, there is no need to be afraid immediately. But due to the pollution we are doing, the weight layer is getting thinner day by day.\nIt cannot be said that ultraviolet radiation will not come directly from the sun tomorrow. In this we are talking about the radiation of Wi-Fi. Normal MHz, KHz, GHz. Terahertz radiation does not affect our health.\nSince the radiation of Wi-Fi is up to 2.4 or 5 GHz, we can use Wi-Fi with confidence. Similarly, the question that comes up about the Wi-Fi antenna is also of very small power. Its power is less than 0.1 watts.\nWhat good is a Wi-Fi antenna with less than 0.1 watts when a bulb of more than 100 watts we are using has no effect?\nSo we don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about Wi-Fi. Even with Wi-Fi on overnight, it consumes very little electricity. If you want to reduce the power consumption even a little, you can turn off the Wi-Fi before going to bed at night.\nSimilarly, turning on Wi-Fi overnight may interfere with the automatic cloud-based backup of your phone, tablet or PC.\nBut, if you have Disabled Auto Backup Cloud, don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid of that either. You can confidently turn on Wi-Fi on day and night.\n","date":"6 August 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/turn-off-your-wifi-while-sleeping/","section":"Welcome to Articles","summary":"Internet usage has become commonplace these days.","title":"Do You Sleep At Night With Wi-Fi On?

Calculating the number of days using Excel is pretty simple. Just use a formula to subtract the later date from the earlier date.\nFor example, if cell A1 contains 1-Jan-2004 and cell A2 contains 03-Mar-2004, you simply enter the formula =A2-A1 in cell A3 to get the number of days. If the result you get looks like a weird date rather than a number of days, that\u0026rsquo;s because Excel assumed you were entering another date and automatically formatted cell A3 as a date.\nTo fix that, from the Home tab click the Number Formats dropdown (in the Number group) and select General. Your answer should be 62.\nHowever, calculating the number of months or years between two dates isn\u0026rsquo;t so obvious. There\u0026rsquo;s a Function in Excel that makes this task easy but for some reason Microsoft has hidden it away. You won\u0026rsquo;t find it in the Functions list (Formulas, Insert Function). This \u0026lsquo;secret\u0026rsquo; function is called DATEDIF (i.e. date difference).\nLet\u0026rsquo;s use the same dates as above. The syntax for the function is\u0026hellip;\n=DATEDIF(startdate,enddate,\u0026ldquo;interval\u0026rdquo;)\nOur formula to calculate the number of complete months between the two dates would be\u0026hellip;\n=DATEDIF(A1,A2,\u0026ldquo;m\u0026rdquo;)\nSimilarly, the formula to calculate the number of complete years is =DATEDIF(A1,A2,\u0026ldquo;y\u0026rdquo;), although in our example it would yield 0 complete years. Change cell A1 to a date a year or more earlier and you\u0026rsquo;ll see the result.\nA few of things to keep in mind about the DATEDIF function: # The start date must be less than or equal to the end date, otherwise it will give an error.\nAcceptable interval codes are \u0026ldquo;d\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;m\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;y\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;ym\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;yd\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;md\u0026rdquo; (with quotes).\nIt may appear obvious what the \u0026ldquo;ym\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;yd\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;md\u0026rdquo; interval codes do but they require a second look. The \u0026ldquo;ym\u0026rdquo; interval code yields the number of months between the two dates as if they were in the same year and ignores the year. The \u0026ldquo;yd\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;md\u0026rdquo; interval codes yields the number of days between the two dates as if they were in the same year and ignores the year.\nTo calculate the number of years, months and days between two dates (more than a year apart) you can use this formula (assuming your start date is in cell A1 and your end date is in cell A2).\nRather than attempting to retype this formula below, simply highlight and copy it from here, paste into your formula bar and then adjust the cell references as necessary.\n=DATEDIF(A1,A2,\u0026ldquo;y\u0026rdquo;) \u0026amp; \u0026quot; years, \u0026quot; \u0026amp; DATEDIF(A1,A2,\u0026ldquo;ym\u0026rdquo;) \u0026amp; \u0026quot; months, \u0026quot; \u0026amp; DATEDIF(A1,A2,\u0026ldquo;md\u0026rdquo;) \u0026amp; \u0026quot; days\u0026quot;\n","date":"3 August 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/docs/excel/","section":"Docs","summary":"Have you ever needed to determine the number of days, months or years between two dates?","title":"Calculate The Number of Days in Excel","type":"docs"},{"content":"","date":"3 August 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/excel/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Excel","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"3 August 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/excel/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Excel","type":"series"},{"content":"","date":"2 August 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/onedrive/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Onedrive","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2 August 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/onedrive/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Onedrive","type":"series"},{"content":"Hope you read our first part of Getting Started with OneDrive or OneDrive for Business.

Originally designed for the Intel x86 platform, it is now available for Intel, Mac, Sparc, Alpha, embedded devices, and many more platforms. Linux is a UNIX-like OS that is very stable, reliable, and flexi-ble. It is used on PCs, professional workstations, servers, routers, and practically every other computing platform. Linux works well in all these environments, and because it is multi-user and multi-tasking, it can perform virtually any job or group of jobs quickly and efficiently. Linux is as powerful as any other operating system, and most importantly, it is free. Linux was created to be a free alternative to UNIX and has become a competitor for all operating systems available today. This fact has enabled Linux to greatly increase its user base, and to be supported and used by the largest corporations and governments in the world. Because of its open nature and technical strengths, Enterprise use of Linux is best illustrated by its large-scale use on the Internet —it powers a majority of Internet applications, including the Apache Web server. Linux has sprung from humble beginnings to become a widely used and respected OS on essentially all computing platforms. Linux is a direct competitor with other high profile operating systems, such as UNIX and Microsoft Windows.
